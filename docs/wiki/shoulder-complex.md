# Shoulder complex (scapulothoracic)

Work in progress on `feat/scapulothoracic`. The arm models still use the MoBL-ARMS shoulder: the sternoclavicular,
acromioclavicular and "unrotate" joints follow `shoulder_elv_r` through linear joint equalities, and there are no
scapular muscles. This page records the port of the thoracoscapular shoulder of Seth et al. (2019) step by step.

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Clavicle, scapula, humerus meshes | identical to this package's, in identical body frames (203, 770, 309 vertices; 0.00 mm) |
| Sternoclavicular centre, glenohumeral centre, elbow offset | same values as MoBL-ARMS and this package |
| Sternoclavicular axes (`clav_prot`, `clav_elev`) | equal to `sternoclavicular_r2_r` and `sternoclavicular_r3_r` |
| Sternoclavicular centre in `chest_r` | this package 2.01 mm anterior of Seth's thorax frame |
| Thorax mesh | Seth's thorax points lie on this package's ribcage mesh (mean 0.06 mm) after a translation of (6.0, -5.0, 0.0) mm, 7.8 mm in all |

Seth's thorax-frame values (thoracic ellipsoid, thorax muscle points) are placed in `chest_r` by the sternoclavicular
shift, so the girdle keeps Seth's geometry relative to the clavicle and scapula. Relative to the ribcage mesh they are
then 7.8 mm off, mostly posterior and superior; the ellipsoid is a kinematic surface (below), so this offset affects only
the drawing and the thorax attachment points, which are checked against the bone surface when the muscles are added.

Seth's ellipsoid (radii 83.0 x 200.0 x 83.0 mm) carries a point of the scapula that lies about 9 mm in front of the
infraspinous fossa, not the bone itself. Along Seth's measured motions the inferior angle stays 26 to 48 mm outside the
ellipsoid. Seth's joint, checked against OpenSim 4.6 to machine precision, is
R = Ry(a) Rx(-e) Rz(u) Ry(w) with the point (rx sin a cos e, ry sin e, rz cos a cos e) on the ellipsoid, for
abduction a, elevation e, upward rotation u and winging w.

## Joint design: A against B

`scripts/fit_scapulothoracic.py --zip <archive> compare` replays all 18 inverse-kinematics trials of the release
(flexion, abduction and shrug, two subjects' sessions, 4312 frames at every third frame) in two candidate girdles built
in Seth's frames with a humerus and a lumped forearm. The IK coordinates belong to Seth's scaled subject model; they are
projected onto the generic model by the least change of the girdle coordinates that closes the AC constraint (as
OpenSim's assembler does; up to 13.8 deg, AC residual below 1e-9 mm).

- **A**: sternoclavicular hinges, clavicle, acromioclavicular ball joint at Seth's AC point, scapula. Scapula-thorax
  gliding is a frictionless contact between a 3 mm sphere at Seth's ellipsoid point and an ellipsoid geom with Seth's
  radii less 3 mm. The scapula can lift off the thorax but not sink into it.
- **B**: Seth's parameterisation as a chain on the thorax (two hinges at the ellipsoid centre, two slides tied to the
  elevation by quartic joint equalities, upward rotation and winging hinges), with the AC point closed by a `connect`
  equality to the clavicle.

Dynamic replay: joint springs pull every coordinate to the trajectory (500 N m/rad; clavicle 50 or 500 N m/rad) under
gravity, with a 20 N press of the scapula onto the thorax at the ellipsoid point; solref 0.008 for the contact (A) and
the connect (B); timestep 2 ms, Euler.

| | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| Kinematic replay, scapula pose error | 0 mm, 0 deg (exact) | 0.048 mm max (slide polynomials) |
| Kinematic replay, AC gap | 0 (tree joint) | 0.048 mm max |
| Dynamic, clavicle 50 N m/rad: AC gap p50 / p95 / max | 0 / 0 / 0 mm | 1.5 / 7.9 / 27.6 mm |
| Dynamic, clavicle 50: scapula position error p50 / p95 / max | 10.8 / 19.5 / 26.1 mm | 10.3 / 17.7 / 65.9 mm |
| Dynamic, clavicle 500: scapula position error p50 / p95 / max | 1.8 / 3.4 / 10.0 mm | unstable |
| Contact penetration p50 / p95 / max (clavicle 50) | 0.33 / 1.14 / 2.39 mm | - |
| Scapula lifted off by more than 0.5 mm (clavicle 50 / 500) | 9 % / 31 % of samples | - |
| Step time of the girdle prototype (CPU) | 5.4-6.3 us | 3.7-3.8 us |
| mujoco-warp (CPU device) against MuJoCo | contact distance equal to 1e-7 mm; 200 steps qpos within 2.9e-4 | 200 steps qpos within 1.6e-5 |
| MuJoCo 3.17 against 4 | identical results | identical results |

For scale, `myoarms` takes 182 us per step today. The position errors of the dynamic replay are mostly the sag of the
springs under the arm's weight and are similar in both designs; the AC gap is not. B is a closed loop whose `connect`
opens by millimetres to centimetres when the clavicle and the scapula are pulled differently, and with a stiff clavicle the
light clavicle in the loop made the 2 ms Euler step unstable. A keeps the AC joint exact; its only soft constraint is the
unilateral contact (penetration below 2.4 mm). A has one degree of freedom more than Seth's joint: the scapula can turn
about the line from the AC joint to the contact point (anterior and posterior tilt), which the scapular muscles control,
and it can lift off the thorax when nothing presses it on. Whether the scapula stays on the thorax at rest is decided by
the muscles' passive forces and is tested once they are in.

**Choice: A.** A support contact for the inferior angle on a larger ellipsoid fitted to its path (rms 2.0 mm) was
also tried; placed as the lower envelope of Seth's data it barely touched and changed nothing, and it is not used.

## Glenohumeral joint

The glenohumeral joint keeps three rotations and no translation, as in Seth's model; its coordinates become relative to
the scapula (the MoBL-ARMS "unrotate" bodies and the rhythm equalities go). The joint centre and frame stay defined on the
scapula, with a named site for the glenoid centre and its orientation and a named site for the humeral head centre, and
no scapular joint depends on a glenohumeral coordinate. Glenohumeral translation, with the capsule and ligaments and a
glenoid contact, is a later step and can be added without changing the scapula.

## Next steps

Muscles (Seth's eleven scapular lines added, the rotator cuff replaced by his sub-region lines, the others decided per
muscle by moment arms against the literature, forces from architecture data), validation against measured scapular
kinematics and rhythms, and the integration into `myoarm` and `myofullbody`.
